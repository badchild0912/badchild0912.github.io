Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

I am a Ph.D student of PRogram Of Sino-French Education for Research ([PROSFER](http://www.ens-rennes.fr/prosfer/programme-prosfer-east-china-normal-university-276624.kjsp)) between [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) and [École normale supérieure de Rennes](http://www.ens-rennes.fr/). I work at [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/) Rennes under the supervision of [Laurent Amsaleg](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Laurent.Amsaleg/), [Yannis Avrithis](https://avrithis.net/) and [Teddy Furon](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Teddy.Furon/website/Welcome.html) in the [Linkmedia](https://www-linkmedia.irisa.fr/) team. 
During the Ph.D, my research focus on the security problem in machine learning. Currently my work has mainly focused on adversarial examples for deep learning systems.

Before coming to IRISA, I worked on Multi-objective Evolutionary Computation with [Aimin Zhou](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/s/1949/t/22631/main.jspy) from 2015-2017. And I received my bachelor's degree in 2015 from Department of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University.
